poly-video-wall_main

- refers to a database of videos which is listed in the node file

- to load videos, :
- ensure the folder in the DB can be accessed
- type search terms
- a subset of videos will be created
"script start"
when script has run, press "query"
- select a number of videos to output using "n of random requests" or output entire list (dangerous)
- each of these is then sent to polymovie



Patch crashes when loading videos to all polys at once, not sure why


Trying to figure out the log files, previous history DLs etc.

On the My Passport HDD: there is:

/Volumes/My Passport/youtube-dl/UNDOWNSCALED/IRCAM/UNSCALED
- contains a ircam-videos.txt which is YouTube links, and a log file which is the paths to the files + tags

/Volumes/My Passport/youtube-dl/ (this whole folder is now copied onto SEBNAS in the location /Volumes/Main-1/CORPUS/CORPUS/VIDEO/youtube-dl)




/Volumes/My Passport/youtube-dl/UNDOWNSCALED/

log.txt in the UNDOWNSCALED folder

Log file starting with:
0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlzzO1e6dws

Later on in file it goes on to reference files in /Volumes/My Passport/youtube-dl/ rather than in the UNDOWNSCALED folder - this means it probably serves as a DB of that folder rather than the UNDOWNSCALED folder. It contains a very large number of video refs c. 25000. These clips refer to the 5-second long clips from my history made back in c. 2019.

The UNDOWNSCALED folder appears tp contain the same files (in a different codec most likely).

Copy of log.txt in the UNDOWNSCALED folder seems to be a smaller version of the same file (missing about 10000 records)

/usbshare/youtube-dl/UNDOWNSCALED/youtube-history-300622.txt is a list of URLs




The YT_Hist folder on AdamsVideo SSD contains 6280 full videos
YT_HistPt2 contains another 2433

Cannot locate the log files for these folders. Eventually found them on AdamsIRCAm where those files must have originated. But the YT_Hist folder here contains 4343 files

The log file yt_dlp_log.txt (in base folder of AdamsIRCAM drive) contains 16199 entries

The three folders YT_Hist, YT_HistPt2 on AdamsVideo and YT_Hist on AdamsIRCAM all seem to contain different files.

Am copying YT_Hist (AdamsIRCAM) to AdamsVIDEO as YT_HistPt3

possibly_duplicates on AdamsVideo seems to have 2343 files. But this seems to be a partial duplicate of YT_Hist on AdamsVideo
